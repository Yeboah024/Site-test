          <p>
            At Great Gold Mining LLC, we offer a trusted and efficient gold trading process designed to deliver maximum assurance and satisfaction to serious buyers.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We supply 23-carat gold with a guaranteed minimum purity of 96%. The gold is delivered to the reputable Sewia Refinery in Accra, Ghana — a fully LBMA-compliant refinery — for processing and export.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            The Buyer is responsible for the export and logistics cost, which is calculated at 4% of the LBMA value. Once this fee is paid, we immediately deliver the gold to Sewia Refinery, where the export process is completed in under 12 hours. We guarantee same-day export after payment confirmation.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            After completion at the refinery, the gold is fully insured and shipped via Emirates SkyCargo or KLM SkyCargo. A trackable Air Way Bill (AWB) is generated, allowing the Buyer to monitor the shipment throughout transit.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            A representative from our team — or the Seller personally — accompanies the gold to the Buyer’s refinery in Dubai for final assay and verification. Full payment for the gold is expected within three (3) working days after the final assay.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            We begin with a trial quantity tailored to the Buyer's financial capability, and upon successful completion, we progressively increase the volume.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Buyers who wish to initiate the process may request an official FCO (Full Corporate Offer) from Great Gold Mining LLC, which includes our official stamp and seal.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            All terms and conditions will be detailed in a formal Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA), signed by both parties before the transaction begins, ensuring full legal protection and transparency.
          </p>
