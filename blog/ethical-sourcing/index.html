    <h1>Ethical Sourcing</h1>
    <p>Sourcing gold, the best way.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="content" data-aos="fade-up">
    <p>At Great Gold Mining LLC, we believe that the journey of gold should be as pure as the metal itself. Our ethical sourcing framework ensures that every ounce of gold we mine and process is free from exploitation, conflict, and unfair labor practices</p>

    <h2>What Ethical Sourcing Means to Us</h2>
    <p>Ethical sourcing involves maintaining transparency, fairness, and responsibility in every step of the supply chain. From collaborating with small-scale miners under fair trade agreements to maintaining strict environmental protocols, we uphold our commitment to doing business the right way. </p>

    <h2>Responsible Partnerships</h2>
    <p>We work only with suppliers and partners who comply with international human rights, anti-corruption, and labor laws. Our procurement practices prioritize traceability and accountability to ensure integrity across the board.</p>


    <h2>Supporting Local Communities</h2>
    <p>Through our sourcing efforts, we contribute to the socio-economic development of mining communities. We promote safe working conditions, equal opportunities, and support for local suppliers to foster inclusive growth.</p>

    <h2>Compliance & Certification</h2>
    <p>GGM aligns its operations with ethical sourcing standards such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance and the Responsible Gold Mining Principles (RGMPs).</p>
